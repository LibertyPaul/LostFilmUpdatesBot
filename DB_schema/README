Patch creation & deployment description

1. To create a new patch call ./createPatch.sh.
   It will spawn a new dir patchXX with 'database.sql' default script.

2. Fulfill patch by creating according directories:
    database
    data_before
    constraints_drop
    indexes_drop
    tables
    indexes_create
    constraints_create
    triggers
    procedures
    users
    permissions
    data_after
    database_after

3. Compile patch (from multiple direcorites/files) to one single file: ./compile.sh patchXX
   Directories are picked up in order as listed in section 2.

4. Replace setup-dependant variables by executing ./insertValues.sh /tmp/patchXXX.sql

5. Deploy patch by calling ./deploy.sh /tmp/patchXXX.sql
